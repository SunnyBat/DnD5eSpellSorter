# DnD5eSpellSorter
A simple Windows Forms and C# project for 5e spells

This was a small project for me to get used to C# JSON parsing and Windows Forms.

XML parsing currently does not work. XML files were taken from https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles and converted to JSON.

Requires Newtonsoft.Json
